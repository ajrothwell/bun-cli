# bun-cli

This is the first test to run auto-translation from a CLI.

It is in npm at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mugstorecowboy/bun-cli

it can be tested on the original project https://github.com/ajrothwell/auto-translator

the steps are:

1. clone that project - https://github.com/ajrothwell/auto-translator
2. get a complete version of the en.json from that project and replace the empty one import/en.json with that complete one.  Do not commit this complete one to the repo
3. run npm i -g @mugstorecowboy/bun-cli
4. in the auto-translate folder, run "translate"
